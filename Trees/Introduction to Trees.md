Tree is one data structure that's quite often used to represent hierarchical data. For example. let's say we want to show employees in an organization and their positions in organizational hierarchy, then we can show it something like this. Let's say the following example is organization hierarchy of some company.

We have to look at the structure upside down and then it will resemble a real tree. The root is at top and we are branching out in downward direction. Logical representation of tree data structure is always like this. Root at top and branching out in downward direction. Tree is an efficient way of storing and organazing data that is naturally hierarchical, but this is not the only application of tree in computer science. Before we proceed to other applications and implementation, let's first define tree as a logical model.

Tree data structure can be defined as a collection of entities called nodes linked together to simulate a hierarchy. *Tree is a non-linear data structure, it's a hierarchical structure*. The topmost node in the tree is called root of the tree. Each node will contain some data and this can be data of any type. In the above tree that we have displayed - data is the name of
