## Get Node Value

[Judge System]()

This challenge is part of a tutorial track by [MyCodeSchool](https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool)

Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and a specific position. Counting backwards from the tail node of the linked list, get the value of the node at the given position. A position of 0 corresponds to the tail, 1 corresponds to the node before the tail and so on.

#### Input Format

You have to complete the *int getNode(SinglyLinkedListNode* head, int positionFromTail)* method which takes two arguments - the head of the linked list and the position of the node from the tail. positionFromTail will be at least 0 and less than the number of nodes in the list. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.

The first line will contain an integer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;t">, the number of test cases.<br>
Each test case has the following format:<br>
The first line contains an integer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;n">, the number of elements in the linked list.<br>
The next <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;n"> lines contains, an element each denoting the element of the linked list.<br>
The last line contains an integer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;positionFromTail"> denoting the position from the tail, whose value needs to be found out and returned.

#### Constraints

- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;1\le{t}\le{10}">
- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;1\le{n}\le{1000}">
- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;1\le{list_i}\le{1000}">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;list_i"> is the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;i^{th}"> element of the linked list
- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;1\le{positionFromTail}<n">

#### Output Format

Find the node at the given position counting backwards from the tail. Then return the data contained in this node. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

The code in the editor handles output.<br>
For each test case, print the value of the node, each in a new line.

#### Sample Input
```
2
1
1
0
3
3
2
1
2
```
#### Sample Output
```
1
3
```
#### Explanation

In first case, there is one element in linked list with value 1. Hence, last element is 1.

In second case, there are 3 elements with values 3, 2 and 1 (3 -> 2 -> 1). Hence, element with position of 2 from tail is 3.
