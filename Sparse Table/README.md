Powerful data structure used for answering range queries in *immutable* arrays. Range queries like MIX, MAX, GCD and etc. can be answered in *O(1)* time complexity, but this approach only supports queries of this approach only supports queries of [idempotent functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence). Even with that weakness I consider this data structure as one of the greatest masterpies of dynamic programming concept.
