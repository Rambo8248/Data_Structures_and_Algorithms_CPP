Powerful data structure used for answering range queries in *immutable* arrays. Range queries like max/min element, max/min index of element, great common divisor and etc. can be answered in O(1) time complexity, but this constant time complexity approach only supports queries of [idempotent functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence). Even with this weakness I consider this data structure as one of the greatest masterpieces of dynamic programming concept.
