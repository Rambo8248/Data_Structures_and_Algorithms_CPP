[Judge System](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/101hack33/challenges/max-sum-subarray/problem)

You are given an array <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;A"> of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;N"> integers.
You need to find the contiguous subarray of the maximum sum in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;A">. The subarray should not contain the number <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;0">. Please find the maximum sum that is possible.

Note 1: The subarray can also be empty.
Note 2: The answer will fit in 32 bit-signed integer.

Input Format

Sample Input

5   
3 4 0 1 2

Sample Output

7

Explanation

The subarray with the maximum sum that doesn't contain a
is .
Hence, the sum is .
