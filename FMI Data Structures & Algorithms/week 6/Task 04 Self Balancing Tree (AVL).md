## Self Balancing Tree

[Self Balancing Tree Judge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/self-balancing-tree/problem?fbclid=IwAR2GqfGk3BV7TYE4hmdoL9bD80TFFOmz_vBvFb5t0xuNrwz_GaxJgIjd1w8)

An AVL tree (Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis' tree, named after the inventors) is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.

We define balance factor for each node as :
```
balanceFactor = height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)
```
The balance factor of any node of an AVL tree is in the integer range [-1,+1]. If after any modification in the tree, the balance factor becomes less than âˆ’1 or greater than +1, the subtree rooted at this node is unbalanced, and a rotation is needed.

([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree))

You are given a pointer to the root of an AVL tree. You need to insert a value into this tree and perform the necessary rotations to ensure that it remains balanced.

#### Input Format

You are given a function,
```
node *insert(node * root,int new_val)
{


}
```
'node' is defined as :
```
struct node
{
int val;            //value
struct node* left;  //left child
struct node* right; //right child
int ht;             //height of the node
} node;
```
You only need to complete the function.

Note: All the values in the tree will be distinct. Height of a Null node is -1 and the height of the leaf node is 0.


#### Output Format

Insert the new value into the tree and return a pointer to the root of the tree. Ensure that the tree remains balanced.

#### Sample Input
```
    3
  /  \
 2    4
       \
        5
```
The value to be inserted is 6.

#### Sample Output
```
    3
  /  \
 2    5
     / \
    4   6
```
#### Explanation

After inserting 6 in the tree. the tree becomes:
```
    3 (Balance Factor = -2)
  /  \
 2    4 (Balance Factor = -2)
       \
        5 (Balance Factor = -1)
         \
          6 (Balance Factor = 0)
```
Balance Factor of nodes 3 and 4 is no longer in the range [-1,1]. We need to perform a rotation to balance the tree. This is the right right case. We perform a single rotation to balance the tree.

After performing the rotation, the tree becomes :
```
                              3 (Balance Factor = -1)
                            /   \
      (Balance Factor = 0) 2     5 (Balance Factor = 0)
                                / \
           (Balance Factor = 0)4   6 (Balance Factor = 0)
```
```cpp
/* Node is defined as :
typedef struct node
{
    int val;
    struct node* left;
    struct node* right;
    int ht;
} node; */


node * insert(node * root,int val)
{
	
  
}
```
