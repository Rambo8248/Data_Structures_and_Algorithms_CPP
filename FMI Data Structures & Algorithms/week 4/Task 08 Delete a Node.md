*This challenge is part of a tutorial track by [MyCodeSchool](https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool) and is accompanied by a video lesson.*

Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and the position of a node to delete. Delete the node at the given position and return the head node. A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The list may become empty after you delete the node.

#### Input Format

You have to complete the deleteNode(SinglyLinkedListNode* llist, int position) method which takes two arguments - the head of the linked list and the position of the node to delete. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. position will always be at least 0 and less than the number of the elements in the list.

The first line of input contains an integer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;n">
, denoting the number of elements in the linked list.<br>
The next <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;n"> lines contain an integer each in a new line, denoting the elements of the linked list in the order.<br>
The last line contains an integer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;position"> denoting the position of the node that has to be deleted form the linked list.

#### Constraints

- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;1\le{n}\le{1000}">
- <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;1\le{list_i}\le{1000}">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;list_i"> is the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;i^{th}"> element of the linked list.

#### Output Format

Delete the node at the given position and return the head of the updated linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

The code in the editor will print the updated linked list in a single line separated by spaces.
