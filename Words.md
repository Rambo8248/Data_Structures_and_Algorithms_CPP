## Words
You are given a string containing Latin letters. Write a program that finds **the numberof all words with no two  consecutive equal characters that can be generated by reordering the given letters**. The generated words should contain all given letters. If the given word meets the requirements it should also be considered in the count.
#### Input
-	The input data should be read from the console.
-	On the only input line, there will be a single word containing all the letters that you should use for generating the words.
-	The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
#### Output
-	The output data should be printed on the console.
-	On the only output line write the number of words found.
#### Constraints
-	The number of the given letters will be between 1 and 10, inclusive.
-	All given letters will be small Latin letters ('a' â€“ 'z')
-	Allowed working time for your program: 0.35 seconds. Allowed memory: 32 MB.
#### Examples
